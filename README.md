# Project Description

This project aims to create an admin portal generator based on a Swagger JSON file. It provides a streamlined workflow for generating an admin portal by utilizing different blueprint frameworks. The portal generated will allow users to interact with APIs defined in the Swagger file.

## Project Goals

1. **Read Swagger JSON File**: The project will include functionality to parse and read the Swagger JSON file, extracting the necessary information about API endpoints, parameters, responses, and other specifications.

2. **Generate Admin Portal with Multiple Blueprint Support**: The project will enable the generation of an admin portal using different blueprint frameworks, allowing users to choose the blueprint that best fits their needs. This flexibility ensures compatibility with various development environments and frameworks.

## Features

1. **Generate Admin Portal with Different Blueprint Frameworks**: The project will provide support for multiple blueprint frameworks, but start with TabTabGo admin portal.

2. **Automatic Service Update**: The generated admin portal will have the ability to automatically update the services it consumes whenever changes occur in the Swagger API. This ensures that the admin portal stays up-to-date with the latest API definitions, regardless of the chosen blueprint framework.

3. **Custom JSON Handling**: The project will provide an option to customize the JSON configuration to handle specific component requirements for each field type. This allows for a more tailored and flexible admin portal, regardless of the chosen blueprint framework.

4. **Layout and Component Editor**: An editor tool will be created to customize the layout and components used in each field type. This allows users to create a visually appealing and intuitive admin portal based on their specific needs, regardless of the chosen blueprint framework.

5. **Support for Different Admin Blueprint Frameworks**: The project will incorporate the ability to generate an admin portal using various admin blueprint frameworks, such as Flask-Admin, Django Admin, or any other popular admin frameworks. This ensures compatibility with different backend frameworks and allows users to select the blueprint framework that aligns with their preferences and project requirements.

By combining the power of the Swagger JSON file, the flexibility of different blueprint frameworks, and the additional features mentioned above, this project aims to simplify the process of generating an admin portal and provide a versatile solution for managing APIs in various development environments.
